MDevCon : Going Mobile with the Cloud: Hands-on-Lab
================

Welcome to the hands-on-lab where you'll learn about connecting Mobile Applications to Windows Azure, Microsoft's Cloud Platform.  Throughout today we'll look at a few different features of Windows Azure and learn how you can take easy advantage of:

* Data storage
* User authentication
* Push notifications
* Backend job processing
* Scalability and reliability

You'll see examples of using these all and then have the chance to implement them yourself with any of the following platforms:

* Android
* iOS
* PhoneGap
* Sencha
* Windows Phone
* Windows Store
* Xamarin
